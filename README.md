# Fractal Experiments

This project is about making cool 3D fractals and learning about the Godot game engine. 2 birds with one stone.

**Requirements**
- Godot v3.3+

## Project Structure

Each fractal is implemented as a shader. To view, just set them as the material shader for the ColorRect node.
